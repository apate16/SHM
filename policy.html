While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0">Service Providers</h3><p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p><p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p><h4 style="margin:10px 0">Analytics</h4><p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p><p><strong>Google Analytics –&nbsp;</strong>Google Analytics is a web analytics service.&nbsp; Google Analytics uses cookies and pixels in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Service, including but not limited to information about the pages where users enter and exit the Service and what pages users view on the Service, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies and pixels allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Service and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Service and other websites to share with us and other website operators information about users including, but not limited to, age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We take reasonable measures to prevent linking of information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies and collection and use of information see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>. To opt out of Google Analytics, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-Out Page</a>&nbsp;to learn about opting out and installing the appropriate browser add-on.</p><p>“Do Not Track” Settings. Because we track website usage information as described above, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of certain information. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of information through cookies or other tracking technologies is to actively manage the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose, data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website may not be able to control other websites.</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0">Links To Other Sites</h3><p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p><p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0">Children’s Privacy</h3><p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 (“Children”).</p><p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3><p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p><p>We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the “effective date” at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
